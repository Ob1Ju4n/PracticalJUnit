****PracticalJUnit*******

This a proyect where you'll find some code examples with the JUnit framework. This examples are based upon Tomek's book
"Practical JUnit Testing with JUnit and Mockito".

There will be code that supports another tools like mockito, power mock etc. I hope it'll grow into a great resource for 
learning. ;)
